          transported in the network and the packets transmitted through the
          Internet, a package in a public logistics network could, for example,
          be sent from a retail store and then routed through a sequence of
          public distribution centers (DCs) located throughout the metropolitan
          area and then delivered to a customerâ€™s home in a matter of hours,
          making a car trip to the store to get the package unnecessary. The DCs
          in the network, functioning like the routers in the Internet, could
          also be located at major highway interchanges for longer distance
          transport.</p>

          Currently, it is common for a single logistics firm like UPS and FedEx
          to handle a package throughout its transport. The such a private
          logistics network, much of the technology used to coordinate the
          operation of the network is proprietary. As a result, the principal
          competitive advantage that a private logistics company has is the
          barrier to entry due to the very large scale of operation (national or
          international) required in order to be able to underwrite the
          development of private facilities and propriety technologies.
          Nevertheless, a single firm, unless it becomes a monopoly, is
          ultimately limited in the scale of its operation, resulting in the use
          of a limited number of large-scale hub transshipment points that can
          result in packages making many circuitous hops before reaching their
          destinations. In a public logistics network, the different functions
          of the network would be separated so that a single firm is not
          required for coordination. This would enable scale economies to be
          realized in performing each logistics function since each element of
          the network has access to potentially all of the networkâ€™s demand. The
          increase in scale would make it economical to have many more
          transshipment points. Each transshipment point, or distribution center
          (DC), could be an independently operated facility that serves as both
          a freight terminal and a public warehouse, and could be established in
          small cities and towns that would never have such facilities if they
          were served as part of a proprietary, private logistics network.</p>

        <h2>Research Issues</h2>
        <p><a href="http://www.ise.ncsu.edu/kay/hdln/">Home delivery logistics
            network</a>: Current research is focused on developing a public
          logistics network in which goods can be delivered to the home in
          reusable standardized containers transported by driverless delivery
          vehicles (DDVs). Overall, the research on public logistics networks
          has produced a set of designs and modeling tools that address the
          following issues:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Coordination:</span> Develop a
              distributed mechanism for coordinating the operation of each
              package, truck, and DC in the network. A pricing mechanism has
              been developed in which each package, prior to its transport,
              submits a bid that reflects its desired speed of delivery. This
              bid is then used to pay each truck that transports the package and
              each DC that stores the package along the path from its origin to
              its destination. Thus, at each DC, all of the packages going to
              the same DC are competing with each other to be in the next load
              to be transported to that DC, and that next load is competing with
              the loads going to other DCs to be selected by a truck as the next
              load for transport. In addition, the trucks are themselves
              competing with each other to select each load for transport.
              Because of this competition, truck capacity can automatically
              adjust to varying transport demand along each link in the network
              without any type of centralized control. The mechanism consists of
              truck and package protocols.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modular storage design:</span>
              In order to be cost-effective, the loading/unloading, sortation,
              and storage activities at each DC in the public logistics network
              must be highly automated since each load might visit a dozen or
              more DCs while itâ€™s in transit, likely traveling on a different
              truck between each DC. Since existing automation technologies do
              not provide the flexibility needed to allow any size load to move
              to any location at anytime, a new DC design has been developed
              that would allow packages of varying size to be automatically
              unloaded at a DC, sorted, stored, and then loaded onto an outbound
              truck. Such a design would result in diseconomies of scale because
              it is cheaper to ship a single package compared to a larger
              consolidated load. Integral to the design is use of arrays of
              small square modules with orthogonal pop-up powered wheels.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Network design and performance
                analysis:</span> Develop a set of modeling tools for estimating
              the performance of logistics networks like the proposed home
              delivery network. Design of the network would include determining
              the number and location of the DCs in the network, but this
              problem does not need to be "solved" in a finite optimization
              sense since the coordination protocols and modular storage design
              allows the network to adapt, with DCs added incrementally in
              response to market conditions. Network design is used just to
              predict performance.</p>

              hub-and-spoke and a point-to-point network covering the same
              region. The public logistics network provided the minimum average
              transport time when the time required for loading/unloading at
              each transshipment point in the network was short. This result is
              robust with respect to a range of different transport demands and
              truck capacities considered in the analysis.</p>

              Whitepaper describing proposed design for the DCs in a public
              logistics network. Main features of DC include: Fully automated
              loading/unloading; packages can be redirected any time prior to
              loading; low cost to build small DC, allowing many DCs to cover a
              single metropolitan area; and a small exterior footprint to allow
              locating in urban areas.</p>

        <h2>Data and Software</h2>
        <p>The data used for the hypothetical 36-DC public logistics network,
          shown below, is available as a Matlab file <a href="plnex36.mat">plnex36.mat</a>
          (8 KB). The file contains the structure DC, with fields containing the
          name, state, and longitude-latitude of each DC, and the population of
          the region surrounding each DC; the matrix IJD, which is the arc list
          for the network that connects adjacent DCs, with distances in miles;
          and XYLim, which are the limits of the region covered. In IJD, the
          distance along each arc is the total road distance between its DCs.
          (See Publication 1, above, for more details and the <a href="http://www.ise.ncsu.edu/kay/matlog/">Matlog
            </a>toolbox for functions that work with arc lists.)</p>

            <p>Hypothetical public logistics network, above, shows 36 public DCs
              covering the southeastern portion of the USA and connected via
              interstate highways. Each of the interstate DCs would serve as a
              hub in a sub-network of local DCs (not shown) covering the region
              surrounding the interstate DC. A package being transported, for
              example, from Jacksonville, FL (DC 4) to Richmond, VA (DC 30)
              would travel on different trucks (operated by different firms)
              between each of the DCs along the way (DCs 7, 24, 23 and 17) and
              could be temporarily stored at each of the DCs (e.g., to wait for
              lower-cost off-peak travel periods).</p>
