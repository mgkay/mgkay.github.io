    <h1>Creating Wikipedia Content for MHI</h1>
    <h2><b>Why Create a Wiki?</b> </h2>
    <p>Use Wikipedia as the platform for MHI’s Industry Groups to reach the
      broader general public by<br>
      creating general-interest Wikipedia entries for topics related to an
      Industry Group’s area of focus.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each wiki entry must be neutral and not reference or promote specific
        Membership companies</li>
      <li>Direct promotion of Industry groups: Wiki entry can have External Link
        to Industry group’s website, and any images provided that are used on
        the page can cite the source (your company)</li>
      <li>Indirect promotion of Membership companies through Industry group’s
        website</li>
      <li>Wiki entry can help in setting Industry definitions and generating
        interest in Material Handling</li>
      <li>New replacement wiki pages were created for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_handling">Material
          Handling</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material-handling_equipment">Material
          Handling Equipment</a>, and these pages can link to any new pages that
        are created.</li>
      <li>New wiki page was created for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College-Industry_Council_on_Material_Handling_Education">CICMHE</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Basic Process to Create/Edit a Wiki</h2>
    <p>As an example of the basic process to create&nbsp; a new wiki page or to
      make significant edits or entire rewrite to an existing page, the
      following is an example of ICWM, the first MHI Industry Group that did a
      wiki, where the group created the content for a major revision of an
      existing wiki page. Caster group (ICWM), lead by Ray Simmons, decided
      existing "Caster" wiki page was so bad that it would be best to create a
      new "Caster" page. <a href="https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/people/kay/">Michael
        Kay</a> served as editor.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Develop an outline for page and assign sections to group members.</li>
      <li>Members send draft content to Michael Kay who created a new page in
        his personal wiki sandbox: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mgkay/Caster">User:Mgkay/Caster</a></li>
      <li>Once draft complete, a notice was posted on existing wiki page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Caster">proposing
          a major change to the article</a>. </li>
      <li>After waiting two weeks and receiving no comments, sandbox page
        replaced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster">existing page</a>.</li>
      <li>After registering with Wikipedia, group members can edit existing
        page.</li>
      <li>Group members can upload images to <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia
          Commons</a>:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li>When doing so, select the <i>Creative Commons license CC BY-SA 4.0</i>
        as the permission of the file</li>
      <li>Uploaded images include info about who submitted the file</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Anyone can edit the page, and you can ask to be notified when any
        changes are made to the article.</li>
      <li>All changes to article are recorded and you can view previous
        versions.</li>
    </ul>
