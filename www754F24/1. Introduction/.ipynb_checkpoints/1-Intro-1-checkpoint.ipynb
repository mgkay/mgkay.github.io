    "## Fermi Problems\n",
    "_Fermi Problems_, named after the physicist Enrico Fermi, are inspired guesses about quantities that seem almost impossible to determine given the limited data that you have available. Solving a Fermi Problem involves _guesstimation_ of the input parameters needed and back-of-the-envelope type approximations.\n",
    "* The goal is to have an answer that is within an order of magnitude of the correct answer (or what is termed a _zeroth-order approximation_).\n",
    "* It works because the over- and under-estimations of each parameter tend to cancel each other out as long as there is no consistent bias.\n",
