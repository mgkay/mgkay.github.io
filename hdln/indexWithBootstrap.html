          Driverless Delivery Vehicles</h1>
      </div>
      <div id="ft">
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A home delivery logistics network</span>
          is proposed in which goods are delivered to the home in reusable
          standardized containers transported by <a href="#DDV">driverless
            delivery vehicles</a> (DDV). Since the delivery vehicle does not
          have a human driver, it is cost-effective to have direct deliveries to
          the home and to have the vehicle wait to be unloaded. A single
          shipment delivered to a home can consist of either a direct delivery
          of a single order from a store or, more economically, several orders
          from stores at different locations can be sent to a small distribution
          center (DC) located near the home and then delivered. Reusable
          containers can be used for each order, with the empty containers
          returned immediately to the DC. In order to be located close to a
          home, the size of each DC has to be small, serving just several
          thousand people. A <a href="#MSD">modular storage device</a> is
          proposed that would make it possible to operate a DC at a small scale
          since no human presence is required onsite. The same module storage
          device used in the DC is used onboard each DDV to make automated
          loading/unloading possible, thereby allowing a single order to be
          transported between multiple DCs at a low cost. A home delivery
          logistics network, as envisioned, would make it possible to eliminate
          all non-recreational shopping for most people. In addition to general
          merchandise, meals and groceries could be delivered to the home. This
          would be especially important for the disabled and the elderly, and
          would allow them to live in a typical sprawling suburban neighborhood
          and still have their shopping needs met, at low cost, without the need
          to drive.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Home Delivery Logistics Network
              Example<br>
            </span>(DCs shown as blue squares)<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
            </span></p>
        </div>
        <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">An example </span>of the
          operation of a home delivery logistics network is illustrated in the
          figure above. Three orders originating from stores located far from
          the home would be sent a DC close to each store and then transported
          through a sequence of DCs until reaching the DC close to the home. If
          these orders do not need immediate delivery, they can accumulate at
          the local DC and then, when a new order needs immediate delivery
          (e.g., a take-out order from a restaurant), it serves to trigger the
          delivery of all of the accumulated orders to the home in one trip.
          Since the final DC is located close to the home, the lead time for
          delivery is short and, since the <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span

            style="font-weight: bold;">trigger order<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span>
          is presumably of no value until it is in the hands of the person, it
          doesn’t matter that it has to be unloaded from the DDV as opposed to
          it waiting for him or her on their front porch, as is current practice
          for most parcel delivery in the U.S.</p>
        <h2>Design Details</h2>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The <a id="DDV">driverless delivery
              vehicle (DDV)</a> </span>shown below represents a possible design
          that could be built on top of the chassis of a low cost electric
          utility vehicle since it would not have to travel at a high speed (max
          25 mph) or for long distances (40 miles between charges). It would be
          fitted with the same suite of sensors and computers as used on a
          driverless car, with the addition of a flashing warning light and
          large emergency stop buttons on all sides since a human passenger
          would not be onboard the vehicle to stop it in an emergency. Its only
          payload would be enclosed array of storage modules that would be
          accessible for loading/unloading from either side.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <p><img title="Driverless delivery vehicle" alt="" src="DDV.jpg"></p>
          <p> </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Driverless Delivery Vehicle<br>
            </span></p>
        </div>
        <p> Although a DDV could be designed to be just a driverless version of
          the today’s typically UPS delivery van, this does not take advantage
          of the big reduction in cost possible due to the elimination of the
          driver’s labor cost. Instead, a DDV can be designed to have a small
          payload, making it cost-effective to provide direct delivery to the
          home. Assuming that it is not going to possible (at least initially)
          to have a DDV automatically unload goods at the home due to the cost
          of providing automated unloading equipment at the home, a person would
          be needed at the home to unload the vehicle. As a result, instead of
          the packages of an individual order being delivered, multiple packages
          from several orders are delivered to the home in one direct trip from
          a DC located close to the home. </p>

              Standardized Container<br>
            </span></p>
        </div>
        <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">A <a id="MSD">modular storage
              device</a></span> is needed in a home delivery logistics network
          so that all loading/unloading, sortation, and storage activities can
          be fully automated. Full automation is needed for cost effectiveness
          because each order from a store to the home might visit a several DCs
          while it’s in transit. The figure above shows a small square module
          with orthogonal pop-up powered wheels. Arrays of identical modules are
          used to form a planar surface in each DDV and DC. Loads in
          standardized containers have recessed tracks on the undersides that
          mate with the module wheels to allow their transport along a module
          array using a series of orthogonal translations without rotation. The
          modules in the proposed design could be produced at a low cost due to
          the scale economies associated with using only a single uniform module
          design and the fact that each individual module would not have to be
          designed to handle the heaviest container because the larger
          containers would occupy more modules and have their weight spread over
          these modules, thus lowering the cost of producing each module. Also,
          it is likely that several small, single-module containers will be as
          cheap or cheaper to store and transport between DCs as compare to an
          equivalent multi-module container because it would be easier for the
          smaller containers to find space available on a DDV for transit and
          within a DC for storage; this is in contrast with the economies of
          scale typically found when shipping larger consolidated unit loads.</p>

          </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Design of a DC</span> is shown in
          the figures above. The proposed design provides the flexibility needed
          to allow any size container to move to any location at any time by
          integrating sortation with storage using arrays of modules. It enables
          high cube utilization during sortation and storage together with full
          accessibility to different size containers. High cube utilization
          reduces the amount of storage space required within a DC, while full
          accessibility provides the flexibility needed to re-route containers
          at any time and it reduces the time and cost associated with
          retrieving items from storage. All loading/unloading, sortation, and
          storage operations are performed on a large open surface composed of
          arrays of pop-up wheel modules. Only individual arrays are visible,
          not the individual modules. In the top figure, DDVs are at three of
          the loading/unloading (L/U) docks. The DC has six levels: one level
          for L/U and sortation and five levels for longer-term storage. The top
          level provides storage for goods requiring frozen storage, and two
          levels provide refrigerated storage. Four elevators are used to move
          loads between levels. As compared to a design that uses traditional
          sortation and storage equipment (e.g., conveyors or an AS/RS), the
          proposed module-based design provides complete container accessibility
          at all times. The design differs from traditional designs by trading
          mechanical complexity for control complexity: each module is a simple
          mechanism, but each container in the system must be continuously
          controlled (even when it is in storage, since it will be continuously
          moving to provide clear paths for other loads. Loading/unloading at a
          DC dock is shown below, where individual modules are visible. At each
          dock, loads of containers are automatically loaded and unloaded to and
          from a fixed array in the DC by positioning a moveable array onboard a
          DDV.</p>

        <h2>Long-Term Impact</h2>
        <p> A home delivery logistics network, as envisioned, would make it
          possible to eliminate all non-recreational shopping for most people.
          In addition to general merchandise, meals and groceries could be
          delivered to the home. This would be especially important for the
          disabled and the elderly, and would allow them to live in a typical
          sprawling suburban neighborhood and still have their shopping needs
          met without the need to drive or own a car. Also, since empty
          containers would be available after delivery, each vehicle would
          provide a low cost means of shipping items from the home; e.g., waste
          requiring special recycling, sending specimens obtained at home to a
          lab, or goods manufactured by a home-based business.</p>
        <p>The proposed delivery service is meant to be cost-effective even
          during the early stages of development for those like the elderly and
          disabled who would likely value the service even at a higher cost and
          longer delivery lead time (initially, relatively few DCs would be
          available in the network). The only two major factors impacting
          overall long-term cost would be the cost of manufacturing the modules
          and the cost of providing driverless technology for a DDV. A DDV is
          likely to provide a good test bed to first deploy driverless
          technology due to their slow speed of operation as compared to a
          driverless car, and so would be the beneficiary of nearly all early
          driverless car developments.</p>
        <p>Initially, the cost of this type of delivery service would only add
          to the cost of the goods purchased at the store (although it would
          eliminate the cost and time required for non-recreational shopping).
          Over time, this cost would decrease because stores would be able to
          eliminate many of their costs associated with stocking shelves and
          checkout, and they could implement a more efficient means of
          fulfilling orders, using more automated material handling equipment to
          receive goods and the same modular storage arrays used in the DCs to
          load orders directly onto DDVs for shipment to customers. Also, as the
          cost of a module decreases, many people might want to purchase a
          modular storage array for use inside their garage (since garage space
          would become available once people are able to call driverless cars on
          demand for their transportation needs).</p>

        <h2>Public Logistics Networks</h2>
        <p>The proposed home delivery network is a based on work done since 2002
          on <a href="http://www.ise.ncsu.edu/kay/pln/">public logistics
            networks</a>. This research has produced a rich set of modeling
          tools for estimating the performance of logistics networks like the
          proposed home delivery network and for generating representative
          loads. In a public logistics network, it is assumed that the different
          entities in the network are separated so that a single firm is not
          required for coordination and that decentralized control can be
          achieved via standard coordination protocols and standardized design.
          All of this work applies to the proposed home delivery network: each
          DC and each DDV can be owned and operated by a separate firm, and
          could coordinate their interactions through the use of a <a href="http://www.ise.ncsu.edu/kay/pln/IMHRC04.pdf">bidding-based
            protocol</a> and a <a href="http://www.ise.ncsu.edu/kay/pln/DSC.pdf">distributed
            coordination mechanism for shipment consolidation</a> developed as
          part of public logistics network research. </p>
