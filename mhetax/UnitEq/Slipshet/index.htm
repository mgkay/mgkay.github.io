<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>DESCRIPTION:</u></b></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The slip sheet is used as a unit load
support device in vehicle delivery and transportation of products.
When slip sheets are supported by a pallet board, roller conveyor
surface, flat load carrying surface, or a cart or lift truck, the
structural strength of the slip sheet supports the product loads
weight [1]. With the slip sheet supported by one of these
transportation devices the unit load can easily be transported
both internally within a facility and externally between two
facility locations [1]. The basic setup for lifting the slip
sheet unit load is seen below (Fig. 1).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>SLIP SHEET TYPES:</u></b></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">There are several types of slip sheets
that can be used for the transportation of a unit load depending
upon the desired use of the sheet. The slip sheet is shaped and
dimensioned to the size of the product or unit load [1].&nbsp;The
type of slip sheet varies depending on both the number of lip
extensions and the material from which it is manufactured (Fig. 2)[1].</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The variation used would depend on the
loading patterns, unit load parameters, and desired
maneuverability of the slip sheet/unit load [1].&nbsp;Normally,
the thickness of the slip sheet is &lt;1/2 in. [1].</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">For most warehouses, plant functional
material handling equipment, and the travel-path clearances, this
fraction of an inch height increase does not stage a problem [1].&nbsp;When
designing an in-house transportation path for the slip sheet unit
load, the slip sheet has a 4 to 6 in. lip (tab) that extends
beyond one or more of the sides of the slip sheet [1].&nbsp;The
lip extensions permit a push-pull device to lift the slip sheet
unit load [1].</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>Single Lip Slip Sheet:</u></b> The
first type of slip sheet is the single lip (tab) slip sheet (Fig.2).</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><img src="Images/slipsht2.gif" width="393"
height="352"></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">With a single lip, the lip faces the
narrow part of the rectangular shaped unit load and the delivery
truck door [1].&nbsp;This slip sheet variation maximizes the
delivery truck&#146;s space utilization and loading and unloading
process productivity [1].&nbsp;Also, with a single lip, the
travel path clearance is minimized as the lip facing the unit
load carrier.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>Multi-lip Slip Sheet:</u></b> The
second type of slip sheet is the multi-lip slip sheet (Fig. 2).
This type of slip sheet is generally used on a container placed
onto a rail car or an ocean delivery vehicle due to the necessary
loading/unloading patterns [1]. This allows a loading device to
load the slip sheet unit load from one side and an unloading
device to unload the load from another side depending on the
number and pattern of the remaining lips.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>LIP HANDLING OPTIONS:</u></b></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">During the transportation or your slip
sheet, there are several options for handling the slip sheet&#146;s
lip [1].</p>

<ol>
    <li>Leave the lip extended allowing for additional clearance
        for the travel path</li>
    <li>Tape the lip against the unit load if additional push-pull
        activities are required</li>
    <li>Cut the lip from the slip sheet if no additional push-pull
        activities are required</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>SLIP SHEET MATERIALS:</u></b></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>Corrugated Slip Sheet Material</u></b><b>:
</b>The corrugated material consists of two kraft liner board
outer surfaces with a corrugated interior that is bonded together
with adhesive or glue [1]. This bonded material provides the
necessary strength for the push-pull device to clamp the slip
sheet once or twice [1]. There are several disadvantages
associated with this type of slip sheet material including that
it is not very durable, moisture resistant, resistant to high
humidity or usable in cold storage areas [1]. The advantages
associated with this material are low cost, one-way use, and its
ability to be moved by a conveyor or lift truck with a slip sheet
device [1]. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>Fiberboard or Solid Kraftboard Slip
Sheet Material:</u></b>&nbsp; The fiberboard slip sheet consists
of several layers of solid fiberboard sheets laminated together [1].
The bonding of layers of several flat solid kraftboard sheets
increases the slip sheet&#146;s non-tear strength [1]. This, in
return, allows the slip sheet to be used several times and in
different temperatures [1]. In addition, some fiberboard slip
sheets are coated with a plastic coating to improve its use in
humid environments [1]. The disadvantages to this type of slip
sheet are that it has a medium cost and is not very durable [1].
The advantages with this material are its multiple uses, ability
to withstand humid and cold environments, and ability to be
handled by conveyors, AGV, or other power unit load
transportation devices [1].</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>Plastic Slip Sheet Material:</u></b>
The plastic slip sheet is made of a combination of polyethylene
materials [1].&nbsp;This type of material allows for greater non-tear
strength and an increased number of uses in cold and humid
environments [1].&nbsp;The only disadvantage to the plastic slip
sheet is the high cost [1].&nbsp;Yet, its advantages include
longer sheet life, durable lips, ability to be stored in cold or
humid environments, and can be handled by a roller conveyor, slip
sheet lift truck, AGV, or powered unit load transportation
devices [1].&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>SLIP SHEET vs. PALLET:</u></b></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">When considering the use of a slip sheet
vs. a pallet, there are several advantages and disadvantages
associated with both.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>Slip Sheet Advantages:</u></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Using slip sheets instead of wooden pallets allows for 12-15%
        more products in material handling containers [2]</li>
    <li>Slip sheets do not require maintenance, but can easily be
        replaced </li>
    <li>Significant reduction in material handling costs</li>
    <li>Decreases loading/unloading time by up to 60% [2]</li>
    <li>Weighs 20 times less than wooden pallets, saving shipping
        weight [3]</li>
    <li>Can be customized to fit any size load [3]</li>
    <li>Eliminates the need for pallet exchange </li>
    <li>Reusable and reliable</li>
    <li>Most are recyclable </li>
    <li>Is cost-effective</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>Slip Sheet Disadvantages:</u></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Pallets provide a greater clearance between the floor and
        the unit load</li>
    <li>Slip sheet usage requires special attachments on
        transportation devices such as a lift truck (but are
        fairly cheap)</li>
    <li>When used alone, pallets provide more structural support
        than slip sheets </li>
    <li>Pallets are easily compatible with crane devices </li>
    <li>Lift truck attachment reduces load capacity</li>
    <li>Greater load damage </li>
    <li>Slower handling</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Overall, the advantages of slip sheets vs.
pallets highly overate the disadvantages associated with the two.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-list:skip"><b><u>CASE STUDYS:</u></b></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-list:skip">&#147;By converting
some of its vendors from shipping on wooden pallets to shipping
on plastic slip sheets, Home Depot figures it has eliminated 1.8
million pallets from its retail operations and reduced costs by $660,000.
Slip sheets (1) cost less than pallets; (2) weigh much less,
saving transport charges; and (3) are only a fraction the
thickness of pallets, thus increasing cube and improving the
efficiency of truck loading. On the receiving end, slip sheets
can be reused, typically 8 to 10 times. Home Depot reuses slip
sheets arriving at its distribution centers to send products to
its stores. When the pull tabs rip and a slip sheet can no longer
be used, it is sent to a plastics processor for grinding, melting,
and remanufacturing.&#148;[4]</p>

<p style="mso-list:skip">&#147;Eliminate wood pallet problems (initial
high cost of purchase, storage space, damage to your product due
to protruding nails, and costly nuisance of disposal of damage
wood pallets).&nbsp; Utilize cost-efficient plastic slip sheets
and all of the above problems are gone! In the past year we have
successfully transferred from wood/or fiber to polyethylene slip
sheets such companies as Hewlett-Packard, Eagle Snacks, Clorox,
Hills Pet Nutrition and J.R. Simplot (french fry mfg. for
McDonald's). Plastic Slip sheets are competitive right now ---the
future will only increase their value.&#148; (Mcnamee &amp;
