<P>1 An owl (like many nocturnal animals) must move its entire head
look in a new direction.  Its light-gathering retinas are so large
that there is insufficient room in the eye sockets for muscles to
move the eyes.</P>

<P>2 A mistake made during an active vision maneuver means the vision
system may be temporarily aimed in the wrong direction, a condition
that usually can be detected by other levels of reasoning and is
recoverable.</P>

<P>3 At print time, the PC microprocessor has been recently upgraded
to a 200 MHz Cyrix chip. </P>

<P>4 The use of this terminology is not completely consistent in the
literature.  Voice recognition is sometimes used to describe
recognition of words, especially in product marketing, e.g. IBM's
VoiceType Dictation(tm).</P>

<P>5 Motion detection during camera motion is possible, but too
computationally intense for this application.</P>

<P>6 The sensor mount for this project was carefully designed with
vibration-absorbing materials isolating the camera, frame, and
microphones to eliminate any direct vibration. However, motor sound
from the Canon VC-C1 motors does reach the microphones through the
air.  During high-speed camera motion, the noise can interfere with
sound localization.  Note that the Canon VC-C1 was the quietest of
several pan-tilt units considered for this project, but quieter
products now exist.  Attempts to characterize the motor noise
revealed that it was quite broadband and would resist most attempts
at removal through simple filtering.</P>
