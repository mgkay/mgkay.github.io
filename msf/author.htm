<P>I wish to express my sincere appreciation to my advisor, Dr.
Ronald S. Gyurcsik, who showed me how to look at education and
research from both personal and career perspectives, and helped me
stay on track to complete this work. I also wish to thank Dr. Michael
G. Kay for his enthusiastic support and expertise in intelligent
sensing research, and Dr. James J. Brickley, whose door was always
open for me and who advised me when no one else knew quite what to do
with me. I wish to express my gratitude to Dr. Ren C. Luo for giving
me the chance to do research in robotics and intelligent systems, and
to Dr. John Sutton, who introduced me to fuzzy logic and gave me the
opportunity to start my research in intelligent multimedia systems.
</P>

<P>I wish to convey my appreciation to Dr. Caglan M. Aras, Mr. Jack
Lucas, and Mr. Scott deDeugd at IBM for the opportunities they
provided for me to work and do research in the multimedia field. I
would also like to thank my fellow students who have helped me, most
remarkably Mr. Jay Russell, who helped port a variety of image
processing functions to the PC.</P>

<P>I thank George Lucas and Isaac Asimov for their inspiring
fictional robots, which started my mind down this path at a very
young age.</P>

<P>Finally, I would like to thank Lauren and my parents for their
love and support.</P>
