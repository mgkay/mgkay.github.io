<P>Goodridge, Steven George. Multimedia Sensor Fusion for Intelligent
Camera Control and Human-Computer Interaction.  (Under the direction
of Dr. Ronald S. Gyurcsik, Dr. Michael G. Kay, and Dr. James J.
Brickley)</P>

<P>This dissertation presents a novel technique for pixel-level
fusion of spatial sound and color information for the detection and
tracking of human beings, coupled with a behavior-based camera
control system.  Such a system can be used for videoconferencing,
surveillance, and human-computer-interaction applications that
require automatic camera control and/or machine perception of people.
 Binaural sound localization is used to assist the task of extracting
faces from video images and to turn the camera toward sound sources
outside the current field of view.  A digital audio preprocessing
technique for developing onset signals from each microphone is
introduced.  The time-domain cross-correlation between these onset
signals provides a sharp peak at the interaural delay that
corresponds to the target location. The resulting peak is narrow
enough to distinguish multiple speaker locations without the degree
of ambiguity ordinarily present with cross-correlation methods. 
Onset correlation and skin color statistics are used jointly for the
classification of "talking face" and "background" pixels in the
camera image.  Occasional classification and measurement errors are
compensated for by Kalman filtering and reactive fuzzy control
behaviors.  The test system, which is based on an ordinary personal
computer, can automatically point the camera at the person or persons
speaking and adjust the camera zoom as appropriate.</P>
